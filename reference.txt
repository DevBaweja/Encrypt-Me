Abbr:
PT - Plain Text
CT - Cipher Text
Ek - Encryption Function
Dk - Decryption Function
k - Key

Encryption and Decryption
CT = Ek(PT)
PT = Dk(CT)

Mono Alphabetic Cipher - 
A monoalphabetic cipher is any cipher in which the letters of the plain text are mapped to cipher text letters based on a single alphabetic key.
One to One Mapping

1) Additional Cipher
src/additional-cipher.js

    Functions: 
encrypt(plain,key):cipher
CT = (PT+k) mod 26
decrypt(cipher,key):plain
PT = (CT-k) mod 26

    Key Domain : [1-25] ie 25 
Excluding zero we got only 25 as key with zero as key
is essentially the same plain and cipher text

Key must have additional 

2) Multiplication Cipher
src/multiplication-cipher.js

    Functions: 
encrypt(plain,key):cipher
CT = (PT*k) mod 26
decrypt(cipher,key):plain
PT = (CT*inv(k)) mod 26

    Requirements:
k*inv(k) mod 26 = 1 

    Key Domain : [1-25] ie 25
Key inverse must exists

12 Keys only with Key inverse
including one as key in that case we will have
same plain and cipher text
